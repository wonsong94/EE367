# Diffusion Model Project

In this assignment, we will use Google Colab to access its GPU. Google Colab is a free
online hosting service where Jupyter Notebooks (an interactive version of a Python code script)
can be run, without you having to download and install Python or any associated packages
yourself. Since we are using the free subscription of Google Colab, the GPU memory is limited
(12 GB). Free Colab notebooks can run for up to 12 hours, depending on availability and your usage patterns.
Hence, you may find that the more you run the notebook, the longer the sampling takes to run.
However, this will be enough for completing this assignment and we recommend that you avoid
unnecessary runs of the code. 

If this is your first time using Google Colab, please follow the instructions below to enable Google Colab
within your Google Drive. 

1. Login to Google Drive with your Stanford email 
2. Go to the Google Workspace Marketplace and search for "Colaboratory"
3. Click the Install button 

Once you have Colab enabled, download the shared folder `diffusion_project` and upload this folder 
to your own Google Drive. `task{2,3,4,5,6}.ipynb` are the only notebooks you need to run, and the rest are
supporting files. To open a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab from your Google Drive, navigate to this file
in your Drive, right-click on it, and select "Open with" > "Google Colaboratory". This will directly open the 
notebook within the Colab interface. Finally, follow the instructions in the notebook and run each cell 
step by step.
